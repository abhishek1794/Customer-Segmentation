# Customer-Segmentation
It was a classification problem to identify the customers with a high probability of conversion (buying a product). So that the potential customers can specifically targeted additional channels and re-marketing. The dataset had around 1 lakh observations that captured basic details about customers. We built classification models using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier to identify the potential customers.
We were able to increase the conversion ratio by classifying customers based on their data available to us.
